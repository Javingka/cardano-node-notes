# Code Disection

This folder contains my own understanding about the contracts found within the `./haskell` folder.

The starting point to study or review the code is to open any contract within the `./contracts` folder, there will be found one .md file referencing a contract code in haskell.

DISCLAIMER: 
This is undertanding in continuos delopment, so it is not a source of true, and depending on the matter could be the case I wrote wrong assumptions or descriptions. So just to be aware.
