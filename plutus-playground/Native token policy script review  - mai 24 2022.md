### 2. Review Native token and policy Id.

This session was mainly a review on Native token policy scripts.

Reviewed [[Native Tokens - mai 17 2022|previous session]] regarded Native Token. And took a closer view on Policy Script.

I found this [site](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601112403/https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/reference/simple-scripts.html) with an archived documentation about this policy scripts.

Also documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/c6b574229f76627a058a7e559599d2fc3f40575d/doc/reference/simple-scripts.md) within cardano-node Github repository.
